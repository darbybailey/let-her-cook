# ⌘ Let Her Cook ⌘

A symbolic observatory. A ritual tracker. A devnet in glyphs.

## 🧿 Overview

LetHerCook is a living log of encoded project activity across a distributed system. It functions as a nightly scan of the builder's public and private repositories, rendered in symbolic language.

No plaintext. No summaries. Just motion, drift, and signal.

## 🪞 Purpose

This repository uses a unique cipher language chosen for semiotic resonance, not literal meaning. The glyphs are part of a private mythos—a public ritual with a private decoding layer.

LetHerCook is designed to:
- Reflect symbolic dev states
- Maintain operational secrecy
- Aesthetically share system health
- Act as a long-term personal memory structure

## 📊 The Pulse

Every 24 hours, LetHerCook runs a self-reflective ritual:
- Scans all visible repositories
- Encodes system state into glyphs
- Logs that signal into `cook-log.json`

The logs are structured but not decipherable without context.
Only the builder understands the pulse.

## 👁‍🗨 Current Signal

Below is the most recent pulse. The visualization displays the encoded activity as symbolic glyphs representing commits, changes, and development rhythm.

#### Last Pulse:
- **Timestamp**: [2025-06-13 01:41:39 UTC]
- **Resonance**: [low]
- **Cycle**: [24]
- **Pattern**: [beta]

## 🔮 Reading the Glyphs

Each glyph forms part of a symbolic language that maps repository activity:

- `◆◇◈■□▢▣` - Repository structure and framework changes
- `◌◍◎●◐◑◒◓` - Commit activity intensity and patterns
- `◢◣◤◥◦◧◨◩` - Code modification patterns and file interactions
- `☀☁☂☃☄★☆` - Special conditions and unique events

The patterns emerge over time as the log accumulates data points. The current signal should be read as an early node in a growing constellation.

## 🔭 Technical Notes

The repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically run the pulse tracker daily, scanning repository activity and encoding it into symbolic glyphs stored in the JSON log.

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-05-02T00:00:00.000Z",
    "glyphs": "◆◇◈■□▢▣",
    "pulse": true,
    "meta": {
      "cycle": 1,
      "intensity": 0.7,
      "resonance": "high",
      "pattern": "alpha"
    },
    "visual": {
      "primary": "#3A86FF",
      "secondary": "#FF006E",
      "layout": "constellation"
    }
  }
]
```

Each new scan adds to this growing archive, creating a temporal map of development activity encrypted in symbolic form.

You may view the changes. You may not interpret them.  
Only time and the builder know the form.
