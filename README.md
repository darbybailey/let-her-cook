# 🍳 let-her-cook

**A symbolic observatory. A ritual tracker. A devnet in glyphs.**

LetHerCook is a living log of encoded project activity across a distributed system.  
It functions as a nightly scan of the builder’s public and private repositories, rendered in symbolic language.  

No plaintext. No summaries. Just motion, drift, and signal.

---

## 🔁 What It Does

Every 24 hours, LetHerCook runs a self-reflective ritual:
- Scans all visible repositories
- Encodes system state into glyphs
- Logs that signal into `cook-log.json`

Logs are structured but not decipherable without context.  
Only the builder understands the pulse.

## 🧪 On Symbolic Encoding

This repository uses a unique cipher language that are chosen for their semiotic resonance, not literal meaning.  
They are part of a private mythos.

---

## 🧠 Design Ethos

This is a **public ritual** with a **private decoding layer**.

LetHerCook is designed to:
- Reflect symbolic dev states  
- Maintain operational secrecy  
- Aesthetically share system health  
- Act as a long-term personal memory structure

---

## 🕯️ About the Log

Logs are committed daily to `cook-log.json`.  
Each entry includes a new symbolic snapshot of all repos at the time of scan.

You may view the changes. You may not interpret them.  
Only time and the builder know the form.
